# How to set up a new GitHub repository
The approach taken in this guide is to first create a local folder in which would act as the working directory.
Then initializing a Git repository in this directory and thereafter creating a repository in GitHub.
The GitHub repository will then be added as a remote origin using the command line, in this case GitBash.

## Create a local folder
Go to the place on your computer where you want to place the working directory, for example the desktop.
Press `ctrl + shift + n` to create a new folder, call the folder the name of the project.
Preferably lowercase with no spaces.
